# Introduction
This toolkit was developed for FLAGRANT® employees, but we hope it&rsquo;s a useful reference for anyone, whether you&rsquo;re on another design team or a member of the press.

## If you work at FLAGRANT®
Our visual identity is a flexible system that helps you communicate clearly while building visual consistency across our work. It features a growing set of templates and guides you can use to meet common design needs — and save time in the process.

This identity is integral to our ability to communicate our goals and deliver high-quality products. We recognize that having a strong brand is as important for our company as it is for our clients, and our users expect nothing less.

Because a brand communicates our core values, it helps us build trust with our partners, increase engagement, foster input and open-source contributions, and improve the public&rsquo;s perception of us and our work, all of which are central to our mission.

## If you work at another organization

Feel free to use the format of this guide with your own branding and identity. Please don&rsquo;t use our visual styles as your own, though. These templates, color palettes, and styles are reflective of our core values, and won&rsquo;t necessarily translate well for your organization and your communication goals.

## Feedback or questions
This is not a complete brand style guide, and it&rsquo;s still an early draft. We&rsquo;ll continue adding to this as we can, but there is no dedicated team at the moment.
